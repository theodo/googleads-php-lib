   * Represents a collection of settings related to ads geotargeting.
   *
   * <p>AdWords ads can be geotargeted using <b>Location of Presence</b> (<b>LOP</b>),
   * <b>Area of Interest</b> (<b>AOI</b>), or both. LOP is the physical location
   * of the user performing the search; AOI is the geographical region
   * in which the searcher is interested. For example, if a user in
   * New York City performs a search "hotels california", their LOP
   * is New York City and their AOI is California.
   *
   * <p>Additionally, ads can be <b>positively</b> or <b>negatively</b> geotargeted.
   * An ad that is positively geotargeted to New York City only appears
   * to users whose location is related (via AOI or LOP) to New York City. An ad
   * that is negatively geotargeted to New York City appears for <i>all</i>
   * users <i>except</i> those whose location is related to New York City. Ads can
   * only be negatively geotargeted if a positive geotargeting is also supplied, and
   * the negatively geotargeted region must be contained within the positive
   * region.
   *
   * <p>Geotargeting settings allow ads to be targeted in the following way:
   * <ul>
   * <li> Positively geotargeted using solely AOI, solely LOP, or either.
   * <li> Negatively geotargeted using solely LOP, or both.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>This setting applies only to ads shown on the search network, and does
   * not affect ads shown on the Google Display Network.
