   * <p>Add - Creates a new {@linkplain AdGroupAd ad group ad}. The
   * {@code adGroupId} must
   * reference an existing ad group. The child {@code Ad} must be sufficiently
   * specified by constructing a concrete ad type (such as {@code TextAd})
   * and setting its fields accordingly.</p>
   * <p>Set - Updates an ad group ad. Except for {@code status},
   * ad group ad fields are not mutable. Status updates are
   * straightforward - the status of the ad group ad is updated as
   * specified. If any other field has changed, it will be ignored. If
   * you want to change any of the fields other than status, you must
   * make a new ad and then remove the old one.</p>
   * <p>Remove - Removes the link between the specified AdGroup and
   * Ad.</p>
   * @param operations The operations to apply.
   * @return A list of AdGroupAds where each entry in the list is the result of
   * applying the operation in the input list with the same index. For an
   * add/set operation, the return AdGroupAd will be what is saved to the db.
   * In the case of the remove operation, the return AdGroupAd will simply be
   * an AdGroupAd containing an Ad with the id set to the Ad being removed from
   * the AdGroup.
