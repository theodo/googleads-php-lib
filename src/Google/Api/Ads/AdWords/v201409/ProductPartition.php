   * Product partition (product group) in a shopping campaign. Depending on its type, a product
   * partition subdivides products along some product dimension, specifies a bid for products, or
   * excludes products from bidding.
   *
   * <p>Inner nodes of a product partition hierarchy are always subdivisions. Each child is linked to
   * the subdivision via the {@code parentCriterionId} and defines a {@code caseValue}. For all
   * children of the same subdivision, the {@code caseValue}s must be mutually different but
   * instances of the same class.
   *
   * To create a subdivision and child node in the same API request, they should refer to each other
   * using temporary criterion IDs in the {@code parentCriterionId} of the child, and ID field of the
   * subdivision. Temporary IDs are specified by using any negative integer. Temporary IDs only exist
   * within the scope of a single API request. The API will assign real criterion IDs, and replace
   * the temporary values, and the API response will reflect this.
