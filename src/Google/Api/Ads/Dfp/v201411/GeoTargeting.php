   * The following rules apply for geographical targeting:
   * </p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>You cannot target and exclude the same location</li>
   * <li>You cannot target a child whose parent has been excluded. So if the state
   * of Illinois has been excluded, then you cannot target Chicago</li>
   * <li>You must not target a location if you are also targeting its parent.
   * So if you are targeting New York City, you must not have the state of New
   * York as one of the targeted locations</li>
